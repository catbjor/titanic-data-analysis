Examining survival patterns by age and gender from Titanic data

The Titanic dataset offers a well-known case for data analysis. 

In this project, I simplified the dataset to focus on two key factors — age and gender — to explore how these attributes related to survival. All work was completed in Excel.

# Data Cleaning

For this project, the following columns were removed to focus the analysis on age and gender:
- Fare
- Embarked location
- Passenger names
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
